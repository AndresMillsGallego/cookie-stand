      <p>Welcome to Pat’s Salmon Cookies! We are so glad that you found us and decided to visit our site. We got our
        start over 30 years ago when our founder, Pat, accidentally mixed some smoked salmon into his batch of holiday
        cookies! Thank goodness he decided to try them before tossing them out! The rest is history, so they say, and an
        empire was born. After one taste Pat knew he was on to something and was quick to enlist the help of his entire
        family to get things going. Our first official cookie sold came from a PTA bake sale at Pat’s youngest son’s
        school.
      </p>
      <div class="pline"></div>
      <p id="middleP">From there the word spread and demand grew. Pat started to hit the local farmers markets and even
        rented a stall
        in the Pike Place Market (right next to the fish throwers as luck would have it)! Interest and demand kept
        growing for this unique product. It was hard to keep up at times, but Pat
        always wanted to stay involved and make sure the quality of his product stayed at the highest level.</p>
      <div class="pline"></div>
      <p>Today we are lucky to be keeping the dream alive and have 5 locations (and counting) all across the globe.
        While Pat has since retired, rest assured that the company is in good hands. Pat’s youngest son Alexander (The
        same Alexander from the bake sale so many years ago), is
        in charge now. He and the entire staff work tirelessly each day to not only continue delivering quality Salmon
        Cookies, but also
        to make his Dad and entire family proud. </p>
