Starting with Lab 06. 
  - Finally.....the DOM!

This project went quite well I think.  I have been wanting to work with the DOM for some time now and it was a lot of fun getting started. It is very interesting how it all works, and so far at least it is something that I understand clearly. 

I don't think I have any questions on this topic just yet, though I am eager to continue working with it to gain more experience. One observation that I made during the 2nd lab was the potential benefits to using several methods in a given object as opposed to just one.  I had already written my code by then using just one method so I left it like that, but I will likely change that up moving forward.  

I finished the bulk of the project the first lab, then spent the majority of the 2nd lab working with CSS.  CSS really can be a time sink, but a fun one!  Since this lab was so new to me I didn't really have an idea of how long it would take me, but having completed it I think I finished it in a good amount of time.
